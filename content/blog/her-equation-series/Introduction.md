For as long as I can remember, I've been drawn to how numbers reflect real lives. Behind every dataset, there's a story --- of people, communities, and the systems that shape them. Her Equation was born from that belief: that data, equity, and sustainability are deeply connected, and that numbers can give voice to issues that often go unseen.

This series is my space to bridge what I've learned in economics and data science with the causes that matter most to me --- gender equity, sustainability, and social justice. Each post tells a story about how women and vulnerable populations experience the world differently, especially in the face of climate, economic, and social change.

Being a woman of color and Muslim, I've always felt a deep responsibility toward social justice --- especially women's rights. My interest isn't only driven by the alarming global reality that over one-third of women and girls experience violence, but also by what I've witnessed and heard from my own country.
