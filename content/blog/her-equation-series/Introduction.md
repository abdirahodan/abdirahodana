For as long as I can remember, I’ve been drawn to how numbers reflect real lives. Behind every dataset, there’s a story — of people, communities, and the systems that shape them. Her Equation was born from that belief: that data, equity, and sustainability are deeply connected, and that numbers can give voice to issues that often go unseen.

This series is my space to bridge what I’ve learned in economics and data science with the causes that matter most to me — gender equity, sustainability, and social justice. Each post tells a story about how women and vulnerable populations experience the world differently, especially in the face of climate, economic, and social change.

Being a woman of color and Muslim, I’ve always felt a deep responsibility toward social justice — especially women’s rights. My interest isn’t only driven by the alarming global reality that over one-third of women and girls experience violence, but also by what I’ve witnessed and heard from my own country.

It’s no secret that when a nation experiences instability, its women often bear the heaviest burdens. In Somalia, I’ve seen and read about challenges such as child marriage, gender-based violence, and social systems that sometimes fail to protect women because of cultural or clan hierarchies. These stories aren’t abstract to me — they’re reminders of why I care so deeply about combining data and advocacy to drive change.

I often ask myself whether violence against women is actually increasing, or whether we’re simply becoming more aware through faster access to information. That question fuels my curiosity and inspires my ongoing data projects. One of them focuses on femicide, where I analyze how rates differ across nations — from affluent countries to those struggling with poverty and instability, like South Korea and El Salvador.

I don’t have all the answers, but I’m endlessly curious. My hope is that Her Equation becomes a space that reminds readers (and myself) that data isn’t just about numbers; it’s about people.

If you believe in using knowledge for good, you’ll feel at home here.
