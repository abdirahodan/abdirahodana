<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a Somali American in my early twenties, deeply passionate about the intersection of data science and economics. With a keen interest in environmental sustainability, my ambition extends to leveraging data analytics to make a meaningful impact in areas like business, technology, and public policy. My goal is to drive change in these sectors, focusing on strategies that are not only economically sound but also environmentally responsible. Through strategic, data-informed decision-making, I aspire to contribute to solutions that benefit both our society and our planet.
