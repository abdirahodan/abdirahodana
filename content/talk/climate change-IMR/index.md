title: "Exploring Links Between Climate Change, Infant Mortality, and Gender - Based Violence in the U.S."
subtitle: "Undergraduate Research"
excerpt: "This study explores the intersection of climate change, infant mortality rates (IMR), and gender - based violence in the United States, focusing on the role of environmental stressors such as CO2 emissions and various extreme weather events. Using a two - way fixed effects model, the analysis uncovers counterintuitive findings, including a negative association between CO2 emissions, most air pollutants, and IMR, potentially reflecting the indirect benefits of economic development. Conversely, NO2 exhibits a positive relationship with IMR, emphasizing its harmful impact on infant health . The study highlights income disparities as a key factor, with econom ic stability reducing IMR despite environmental risks. These findings emphasize the necessity for integrated policies that tackle environmental, social, and economic vulnerabilities to improve public health and promote gender equity in the context of clima te change"
